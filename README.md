You will find three folders:

-the first one entitled programs-to-simulate-BDM-process gathers all the files necessary to create and illustrate the BDM process. These programs are needed to run the examples in the other two folders. You must therefore place them in the same folder before running the simulations.

-the second one, called simple-example, contains a python file which allows to fix the characteristics and then to simulate a simple example: particles moving on the square [-1,1]x[-1,1] and all following a Brownian motion.

-The third one, entitled real-example, contains all the data necessary to simulate the example presented in the article.

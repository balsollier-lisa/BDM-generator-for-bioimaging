These codes and data are part of the supporting information of the article "A generative model to synthetize spatio-temporal dynamics of biomolecules in cells" by L. Balsollier, F? Lavancier, J. Salamero and C. Kervrann (available on arXiv: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06951.pdf).

- ''Code'' contains the Python functions  to simulate a BDM process and plot some descriptors of the result. These programs are needed to run the examples in ''A-simple-example-of-simulation'' and  ''A-realistic-example-of-simulation''

- ''A-simple-example-of-simulation'' is an illustrative example of simulation of a simple BDM process, where the particles move inside the square [-1,1]x[-1,1], each following a Brownian motion with reflective boundary conditions, and where the jumps occurs at a uniform rate. 

- ''A-realistic-example-of-simulation'' contains all materials to generate the BDM process considered in Section 3.2 in the article, and plot some descriptors. 

- ''Real-dataset'' contains the real-data presented in the article

- ''Some-simulation-results'' contains several independent simulation results of the BDM process considered in Section 3.2 of the article.

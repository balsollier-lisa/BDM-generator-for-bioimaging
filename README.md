You find three folders:

- ''Code'' gathers all the files necessary to create and illustrate the BDM process. These programs are needed to run the examples in the other two folders. You must therefore place them in the same folder before running the simulations.

- ''A-simple-example-of-simulation'' contains a python file which allows to fix the characteristics and then to simulate a simple example: particles moving on the square [-1,1]x[-1,1] and all following a Brownian motion.

- ''A-realistic-example-of-simulation'' contains all the data necessary to simulate the example presented in the article

- ''Real-dataset'' contains the real data presented in the article

- ''Some-simulation-results'' contains 10 simulation sets including the two presented in the article

# real dataset

You find three folders : 

-The two csv files containing the real data on which we rely, one for the Langerin particles and one for the Rab11. Each of the two files contains the spatial coordinates of the particles, at each frame, as well as the number of the trajectory to which they belong, as well as the type of motion they have (1 for Brownian, 2 for superdiffusive and 3 for subdiffusive).

-The mp4 file is the video sequence of the real data, we find in blue the Brownian particles, in red the superdiffusive ones, in green the subdiffusive ones and the Langerin ones are represented by a point while the Rab11 are represented by a triangle.

# Real-example

The Python file real-example contains programs that allow to define all the characteristics (displacement, intensities and kernels) of the example presented in the article where two types of particles move in a cell following three possible types of motion: a Brownian motion, a Brownian motion with linear drift and a confined motion.  
At the end of this program, you find the command to generate the process and then the commands necessary to generate the different plots presented in the article, namely the trajectories of the process, the boxplots of the number of particles at each moment, the histograms of the length of the trajectories... 

You have to put this program in the same folder as the files in the programs-to-simulate-BDM-process folder to run it. You will also have to put in this same folder the .pickle files of this folder so that the python programs can import them.

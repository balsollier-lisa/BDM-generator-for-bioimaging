# Realistic-example-of-simulation

The Python file ''realistic-example.py'' allows to define all the characteristics of the example presented in Section 3.2 of the article, where two types of particles move in a cell following three possible motion regimes: a Brownian motion, a Brownian motion with a linear drift and a confined (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck) motion. At the end of the program, there is the command to generate the process (then the current time of simulation is displayed, up to the final time which is by default 167.86), followed by some commands to plot different descriptors of the generated process. 

This program calls the functions in the “Code” folder. 

The pickle files are data used in the definition of the characteristics of the process.

# Programs to simulate BDM process

In this folder, you will find two Python files:

-the first one entitled process.py gathers all the programs necessary to the creation of the process and in particular the proctotal program which takes in argument all the characteristics of the process (final time of simulation, fa\c con to move, the intensities of birth, death and transformation, the nuclei of birth, death and transformation) and returns all the coordinates of the particles present at each moment of the simulation. 

-The second one, entitled draw.py, contains several programs which recover as inputs the output elements of the python.py program which are necessary for them and allow to represent graphically either the trajectories, or the histograms of the lengths of the trajectories, or the boxplots of the number of elements present, or to make a video of the simulated process according to the program used.

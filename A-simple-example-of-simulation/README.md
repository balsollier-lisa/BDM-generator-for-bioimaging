# A-simple-example-of-simulation


The ''simple_example_of_simulation.py'' file allows to define all the characteristics of a simple example of BDM process, to generate it, and to plot some descriptors. For this example,  the particles move independently inside the square [-1,1]x[-1,1], according to a Brownian motion with reflective boundary conditions, are born uniformly in the square at a uniform rate, and all have the same probability to die at each moment. 

This program calls the functions in the “Code” folder.

# A-simple-example-of-simulation


The simple_example_of_simulation.py  file contains programs that allow to define all the characteristics (move, intensities and kernels) of a simple example where the particles move on the square [-1,1]x[-1,1], all follow a Brownian motion, are born uniformly on the square and all have the same probability to die at each moment. 
At the end of this program, you find the command to generate the process and then the command to make a video of the simulated process.

You need to put this program in the same folder as the files in the Code folder to run it.

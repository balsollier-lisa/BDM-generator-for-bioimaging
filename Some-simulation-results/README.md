# Some-simulation-results 

This folder contains the results of 20 simulations. The folders "simu0" and "simu1" contain the results of the two simulations presented in the article.

In each sub-folder, you can find:

- "trajectories.png": a plot of the trajectories of the Langerin proteins
- "number_per_frame.png": boxplot of the number of Langerin proteins in each frame, classified by type of movement
- "size_of_trajectories.png": a histogram of the length of the trajectories of the Langerin proteins
- "details.txt": file containing details about this simulation (number of Brownian births, number of superdiffusive deaths... etc)

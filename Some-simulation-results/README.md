# Some-simulation-results 

This folder contains the results of 20 simulations. The folders ``simu0'' and ``simu1'' contain the results of the two simulations presented in the article.

In each sub-folder, you can find:

-a plot of the trajectories of the Langerin proteins
-a boxplot of the number of Langerin proteins in each frame, classified by type of movement
-a histogram of the length of the trajectories of the Langerin proteins
- a .txt file containing details about this simulation (number of Brownian births, number of superdiffusive deaths... etc)
